  /**
   * `eventsByTag` is used for retrieving events that were marked with
   * a given tag, e.g. all events of an Aggregate Root type.
   *
   * To tag events you create an `akka.persistence.journal.EventAdapter` that wraps the events
   * in a `akka.persistence.journal.Tagged` with the given `tags`.
   * The tags must be defined in the `tags` section of the `akka.persistence.cassandra` configuration.
   *
   * You can use [[akka.persistence.query.NoOffset]] to retrieve all events with a given tag or
   * retrieve a subset of all events by specifying a [[TimeBasedUUID]] `offset`.
   *
   * The offset of each event is provided in the streamed envelopes returned,
   * which makes it possible to resume the stream at a later point from a given offset.
   * The `offset` parameter is exclusive, i.e. the event corresponding to the given `offset` parameter is not
   * included in the stream. The `Offset` type is `akka.persistence.query.TimeBasedUUID`.
   *
   * For querying events that happened after a long unix timestamp you can use [[timeBasedUUIDFrom]]
   * to create the offset to use with this method.
   *
   * In addition to the `offset` the envelope also provides `persistenceId` and `sequenceNr`
   * for each event. The `sequenceNr` is the sequence number for the persistent actor with the
   * `persistenceId` that persisted the event. The `persistenceId` + `sequenceNr` is an unique
   * identifier for the event.
   *
   * The returned event stream is ordered by the offset (timestamp), which corresponds
   * to the same order as the write journal stored the events, with inaccuracy due to clock skew
   * between different nodes. The same stream elements (in same order) are returned for multiple
   * executions of the query on a best effort basis. The query is using a batched writes to a
   * separate table that so is eventually consistent.
   * This means that different queries may see different
   * events for the latest events, but eventually the result will be ordered by timestamp
   * (Cassandra timeuuid column).
   *
   * However a strong guarantee is provided that events for a given persistenceId will
   * be delivered in order, the eventual consistency is only for ordering of events
   * from different persistenceIds.
   *
   * The stream is not completed when it reaches the end of the currently stored events,
   * but it continues to push new events when new events are persisted.
   * Corresponding query that is completed when it reaches the end of the currently
   * stored events is provided by [[currentEventsByTag]].
   *
   * The stream is completed with failure if there is a failure in executing the query in the
   * backend journal.
