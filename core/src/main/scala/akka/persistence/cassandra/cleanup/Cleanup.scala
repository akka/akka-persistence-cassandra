/**
 * Tool for deleting all events and/or snapshots for a given list of `persistenceIds` without using persistent actors.
 * It's important that the actors with corresponding `persistenceId` are not running
 * at the same time as using the tool.
 *
 * If `neverUsePersistenceIdAgain` is `true` then the highest used sequence number is deleted and
 * the `persistenceId` should not be used again, since it would be confusing to reuse the same sequence
 * numbers for new events.
 *
 * When a list of `persistenceIds` are given they are deleted sequentially in the order
 * of the list. It's possible to parallelize the deletes by running several cleanup operations
 * at the same time operating on different sets of `persistenceIds`.
