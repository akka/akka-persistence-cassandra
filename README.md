## History

This [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) plugin to Akka Persistence was initiated [originally](https://github.com/krasserm/akka-persistence-cassandra) by Martin Krasser, [@krasserm](https://github.com/krasserm) in 2014.

It moved to the [Akka](https://github.com/akka/) organisation in 2016 and the first release after that move was 0.7 in January 2016.
