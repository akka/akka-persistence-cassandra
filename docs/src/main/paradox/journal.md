# Journal

### Features

- All operations required by the Akka Persistence @extref:[journal plugin API](akka:scala/persistence.html#journal-plugin-api) are fully supported.
- The plugin uses Cassandra in a pure log-oriented way i.e. data is only ever inserted but never updated (deletions are made on user request only).
- Writes of messages are batched to optimize throughput for `persistAsync`. See @extref:[batch writes](akka:scala/persistence.html#batch-writes) for details how to configure batch sizes. The plugin was tested to work properly under high load.
- Messages written by a single persistent actor are partitioned across the cluster to achieve scalability with data volume by adding nodes.
- @extref:[Persistence Query](akka:scala/persistence-query.html) support by `CassandraReadJournal`

### Schema 

The keyspace and tables needs to be created before using the plugin. 
  
@@@ warning

Auto creation of the keyspace and tables
is included as a development convenience and should never be used in production. Cassandra does not handle
concurrent schema migrations well and if every Akka node tries to create the schema at the same time you'll
get column id mismatch errors in Cassandra.

@@@

The default keyspace used by the plugin is `akka`, it should be created with the
NetworkTopology replication strategy with a replication factor of at least 3:

```
CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS akka WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', '<your_dc_name>' : 3 }; 
```

For local testing you can use the following:

@@snip [journal-schema](/target/journal-keyspace.txt) { #journal-keyspace } 

There are multiple tables required. These need to be created before starting your application.
For local testing you can enable `cassnadra-plugin.journal.table-autocreate`. The default table definitions look like this:

@@snip [journal-tables](/target/journal-tables.txt) { #journal-tables } 

### Configuration

To activate the journal plugin, add the following line to your Akka `application.conf`:

    akka.persistence.journal.plugin = "akka.persistence.cassandra.journal"

This will run the journal with its default settings. The default settings can be changed with the configuration properties defined in [reference.conf](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-cassandra/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf):

All Cassandra driver settings are via its [standard profile mechanism](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.4/manual/core/configuration/).

One important setting is to configure the database driver to retry the initial connection:

`datastax-java-driver.advanced.reconnect-on-init = true`

It is not enabled automatically as it is in the driver's reference.conf and is not overridable in a profile.

#### Consistency

By default the journal uses `QUORUM` for all reads and writes.
For setups with multiple datacentres this can set to `LOCAL_QUORUM` to
avoid cross DC latency.
Any other consistency level is highly discouraged.

```
datastax-java-driver.profiles {
  akka-persistence-cassandra-profile {
    basic.request.consistency = QUORUM
  }
}
```
#### Journal settings

@@snip [reference.conf](/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf) { #journal }

#### Cassandra driver overrides

@@snip [reference.conf](/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf) { #profile }

#### Shared settings for all parts of the plugin

The following settings are shared by the `journal`, `query`, and `snapshot` parts of the plugin and are under
`akka.persistence.cassandra`: 

@@snip [reference.conf](/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf) { #shared }

Events by tag configuration is under `akka.persistence.cassandra.events-by-tag` and shared
b `journal` and `query`.

@@snip [reference.conf](/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf) { #events-by-tag }


### Caveats

- Detailed tests under failure conditions are still missing.
- Range deletion performance (i.e. `deleteMessages` up to a specified sequence number) depends on the extend of previous deletions
    - linearly increases with the number of tombstones generated by previous permanent deletions and drops to a minimum after compaction
- For versions prior to 0.80 events by tag uses Cassandra Materialized Views which are a new feature that has yet to stabilise
  Use at your own risk, see [here](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d81a61da48e1b872d7599df4edfa8e244d34cbd591a18539f724796f@%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E) for a discussion on the Cassandra dev mailing list.
  Version 0.80 and on migrated away from Materialized Views and maintain a separate table for events by tag queries.


These issues are likely to be resolved in future versions of the plugin.

### Schema 

The keyspace and tables must be created before using the plugin. Auto creation of the keyspace and tables
is included as a development convenience and should never be used in production. Cassandra does not handle
concurrent schema migrations well and if every Akka node tries to create the schema at the same time you'll
get column id mismatch errors in Cassandra.

The default keyspace used by the plugin is called `akka`, it should be created with the
NetworkTopology replication strategy with a replication factor of at least 3:

```
CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS akka WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', '<your_dc_name>' : 3 }; 
```

For local testing, and the default if you enable `akka.persistence.cassandra.journal.keyspace-autocreate` you can use the following:

@@snip [journal-schema](/target/journal-keyspace.txt) { #journal-keyspace }
