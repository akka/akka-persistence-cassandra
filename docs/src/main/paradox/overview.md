# Overview

The Akka Persistence Cassandra plugin allows for using [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org) as a backend for [Akka Persistence](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence.html) and [Akka Persistence Query](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence-query.html).

## Dependencies

@@dependency [Maven,sbt,Gradle] {
  group=com.typesafe.akka
  artifact=akka-persistence-cassandra_$scala.binary.version$
  version=$project.version$
}

This plugin depends on Akka 2.5.x and note that it is important that all `akka-*` dependencies are in the same version, so it is recommended to depend on them explicitly to avoid problems with transient dependencies causing an unlucky mix of versions.

The table below shows Akka Persistence Cassandraâ€™s direct dependencies and the second tab shows all libraries it depends on transitively.
