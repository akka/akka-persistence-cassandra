# Database Cleanup

@@@ warning

When running any operation for a persistence id the actor with that persistence id must not be running!

If possible, it is best to keep all events in an event sourced system. That way new [projections](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/current/index.html) 
and the `tag_view` table can be re-built if it is corrupted (e.g. due to a two persistence ids writing events from two nodes in a split brain).

In some cases keeping all events is not possible. `EventSourcedBehavior`s can automatically snapshot state and delete events as described in the [Akka docs](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/persistence-snapshot.html#snapshot-deletion).
Snapshotting is useful even if events aren't deleted as it speeds up recovery.

The @apidoc[akka.persistence.cassandra.cleanup.Cleanup] tool can retrospectively clean up the journal. Its operations include:

* Delete all events for a persistence id
* Delete all events and tagged events for the `eventsByTag` query
* Delete all snapshots for a persistence id
* Delete all snapshots and events for a persistence id keeping the latest N snapshots and all the events after them. 

The cleanup tool can be combined with the @ref[query plugin](./read-journal.md) which has a query to get all persistence ids.

By default, all operations only print what they were going to do. Once you're happy with what the cleanup tool is going to do set `akka.persistence.cassandra.cleanup.dry-run = false`
